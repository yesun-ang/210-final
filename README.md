# Predicting song performance 
This project aims to predict and analyze the top 10 performing songs for any year by examining different features such as Danceability, Speechiness, Loudness, Energy, Acousticness, Intrumentalness and Valence. 
We used spotify's data from kaggle. 
## Dataset 
This dataset can be accessed from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brunoalarcon123/top-200-spotify-songs-dataset/data 
## Setup Intructions 
#### Running the Jupyter Notebook 
Open **210projfinal.ipynb** and ensure all necessary libraries are imported. Add the downloaded dataset from kaggle into the same folder as **210projfinal.ipynb**. 
Additionally, make sure the path to the downloaded csv file is correct and personalized to your device.
